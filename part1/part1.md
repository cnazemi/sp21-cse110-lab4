# 1a

1. values added: 20
2. final result: 20
3. values added: 20
4. error, because the result variable was a let, meaning it could only be accessed inside the if statement block it was created in.
5. error, because result was declared as a const so you can't change it, changing result to equal num1 + num2 after its declaration will cause an error. 
6. error, because the result variable is outside the block it was declared in.


# 1b

1. error, i doesn't exist outside the scope of the for loop it was declared for.
2. it will print the last value that discountedPrice had before the for loop terminated.
3. it will print the last value that finalPrice had before the for loop terminates.
4. [50, 100, 150] It returns the discounted price of 50%, so each value in the inputted prices is halved.
